=============================

A simple tool for choosing package specific USE flags for a given package. This
program will run emerge to determine available USE flags, will list current USE
flags for the package, and then give the option to choose USE flags for the
package.

This script will read /etc/portage/package.use, therefore must be run as a
user who can read to /etc/portage/package.use. Once finished, the script
will write to a file in the current working directory with the new
package.use file.

Usage
-----

	puz.py [-h] [-v] [-s] <package>

Run with -h for more information.

Examples
--------

Choose USE flags for sys-kernel/gentoo-sources
	puz.py sys-kernel/gentoo-sources
